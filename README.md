# Welcome to the test for your Net Consult application

If your are here, it's because you have applied for a job in our organization.

Remember that the point of this test is to have an idea of your knowledge in Javascript but more important it's about your logic and work habits.
An experimented developer needs aproximatively 2 to 3 hours to do all the exercises.

When you finished, please send your answer in a public git repository and send the link at adrien@netconsult.dev.

Good Luck!
